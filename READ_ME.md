##Cipher: Encode and Decode Your Secret Messages

Program encodes and decodes messages.
All usual symbols from the keybord can be used for encryption.

**HOW TO RUN A PROGARM?**

To run a prograrm main.py should be stated on terminal.

You will be able to select how you would like to input the message for encryption. Two methods are available:
* to imput the message directly to the command line
* to use the message form file "texttoencrypt.txt"

After Encrypting the message, program will ask if you want to:
* save the key and initial indexes of symbols needed to decrypt the code.
* decrypt the message using the program 

**STUCTURE OF FILES**

texttoencrypt.txt - file, that can be chosen to be encrypted. 
Encrypted_message - file, that prints out encrypted message
key.txt - file, that allows to decrypt the encrypted file. 
Output - file, that gives back the initial message, that was encrypted.
